## PROTOTYPE SHOP SITE
This is a prototype of a fictional online retailer "ShopEase". This is super quick prototype concept for a college module.

The site is written in HTML, JS, with Node.Js for the back end, and Sqlite3 for the DB's. This is my first time using Node + writing my own back end & working with sqlite.
This is not a safe site, and their is a lot of things I would do differently, but learnt alot about Coors, Express.js, API calls, among other things.

## HOW TO SET UP
Clone the repo, and make sure you've got Node v22.14.0. Also, install sqlite3 if you want to have looksy at the db's
npm install to get all the module dependancies.
The, run all the .js files in the /backend folder (these are your mock DB's for products, users, and orders). Run using node.
Run server.js with node.
